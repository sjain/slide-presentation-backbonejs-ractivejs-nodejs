# :microscope: NomNom Frontend Coding challenge!

## :page_with_curl: Presentation viewer!

# :tv: Demo

![demo](http://i.imgur.com/CWMxoW3.gif)

# :cake: Requirements

Build a single page application which allows users to:

- select a deck from all available decks
- view all slides in a given deck
- render all contents of a deck in each slide
- visualize deck viewing statistics (not included in the demo gif)
- it has to look decent :-) (definitely not like the demo in the gif)

The slide information is available via an API bundled with this challenge..

You can get information from the API about:
- available decks
- number of slides for a deck
- request each slide for a deck
- visitor statistics for each deck

# :computer: Setup

This gist repo includes:

- `index.js` - tiny node application server:
  - it can serve any static files in this directory
  - also hosts the API (documented below)

- `index.html`, `app.js` - main application files
  these are the entry points for your solution

## :rocket: To start

- clone this gist
- `npm install`
- `node index.js`
- navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## :+1: Your solution

You have to implement the solution using the following
stack. It consists of:

- Backbone
- Mustache/Handlebars
- RactiveJS
- SASS
- RequireJs

You can add any extra libraries, for example for charting or build tool.
However full frameworks like Angular, Marionette or Ember are not allowed.

## :no_good: Do not modify index.js and slides.json!

### :sparkles: Bonus points:

- :package: modular code
- :cherries: tests
- :blue_book: detailed documentation on how to get solution running

## :globe_with_meridians: API documentation

### `GET /api/decks`

 Return a list of available decks. Example:

`curl http://localhost:3000/api/decks`

```json
 { "decks" : ["cookies", "ruby"] }
```

### `GET /api/decks/:name`

Return number of slides for a deck. Example:


`curl http://localhost:3000/api/decks/cookies`

```json
 { "slides": 20 }
 ```

### `GET /api/decks/:name/stats/visitors`

Returns (randomized) daily numbers of visitors


`curl http://localhost:3000/api/decks/cookies/stats/visitors`

```json
[
    {
        "timestamp": 1447004056597,
        "value": 667
    },
    {
        "timestamp": 1446917656597,
        "value": 197
    },
    {
        "timestamp": 1446831256597,
        "value": 212
    }
]
```


### `GET /api/decks/:name/stats/countries`

Returns a (randomized) breakdown of visitor countries.

`curl http://localhost:3000/api/decks/cookies/stats/countries`



```json
[
    {
        "country": "UK",
        "value": 667
    },
    {
        "country": "Portugal",
        "value": 197
    },
    {
        "country": "Netherlands",
        "value": 212
    }
]
```


### `GET /api/decks/:name/slide/:number`

Get slide :number from a deck :id. Slide numbers start from 1. Example:

`curl http://localhost:3000/api/decks/cookies/slide/1`

```json
 {
 "slide" : [
   { "heading" : "hello" },
   { "image" : "http://example.com/test.jpg" },
   { "para" : "I'm a paragraph!" }
 ],
 "slides" : 10
 }
```

A slide consists of an array of elements. There are 3 types of elements:
  - heading - a title or heading for a slide
  - image - an URL to an image
  - para - a paragraph of text, it might contain html

Elements can appear in any order.
